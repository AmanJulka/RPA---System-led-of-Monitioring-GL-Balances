## 📊 System-Led Monitoring of GL Balances Automation 🚀

###  Proactive GL Balance Monitoring & Branch Notification 🏦 - Ensuring Zero Balance GL Compliance & Reducing Manual Follow-Ups!

This project automated the daily monitoring of General Ledger (GL) balances across YES Bank branches. The solution proactively identifies GLs with balances (where zero balance is expected), automatically notifies branches, and generates MIS reports, eliminating time-consuming manual follow-ups and ensuring GL balance compliance.

### 🎯 Requirement: Manual, Time-Consuming Branch Follow-up for GL Balances

The existing process for monitoring GL balances and following up with branches was inefficient and resource-intensive:

*   **😓 Manual GL Balance Checks:**  OSD team had to manually check End-of-Day (EOD) GL balances daily.
*   **⏱️ Time-Consuming Data Filtering:**  Manually filtering GLs with non-zero balances from large data spool files was a time-consuming process.
*   **📤 Manual Branch Notifications:**  Sending individual emails and following up with each branch having GL balances required significant manual effort.
*   **📝 Manual Tracker Maintenance:**  Tracking branch follow-ups and responses was likely done manually, potentially in spreadsheets, lacking a centralized system.
*   **📉 Inefficient Resource Utilization:** OSD team's valuable time was spent on repetitive manual monitoring and follow-up tasks instead of more strategic activities.

### 🤖 Automation Approach:  Proactive Monitoring, Automated Notifications, and MIS Reporting

Our automation strategy focused on creating a system-led approach to GL balance monitoring and branch communication:

*   **🔄 Automated Data Extraction from FCC DB:** 🤖 Bot is scheduled to run daily and automatically executes **SQL queries against the FCC (Flexcube Core Banking) database** to extract the required GL balance data.
*   **🔍 Identification of GLs with Balances:** 🤖 Bot intelligently filters the extracted data to identify **GL codes with non-zero balances**, focusing on GLs where a zero EOD balance is the norm.
*   **📧 System-Led Auto-Notification to Branches:** 🤖 For branches with identified GL balances, the bot automatically sends out **notification emails**, informing them about the balance and prompting necessary action.  Crucially, this is done **without creating manual trackers or work items for branch users**, minimizing disruption to their workflows.
*   **📊 System-Led MIS Report Generation:** 🤖 Bot automatically generates **MIS reports** detailing GLs with balances and the branches that have been notified, providing management with clear visibility into GL balance status and branch responsiveness.
*   **🗂️ Master Maintenance Capabilities:** 🤖  The solution incorporates **master maintenance** functionalities for:
    *   **GL Code Management:**  Maintaining a master list of GL codes to be monitored.
    *   **Branch Upload:**  Managing branch information and contact details for notifications.
    *   **Email Maintenance:**  Configuring and updating email distribution lists for branch notifications and MIS reports. *(While detail is limited, the template assumes basic master data management is part of "Future State")*

### ✨ Role of Automation:  From Reactive Follow-up to Proactive Balance Management

Automation transformed GL balance monitoring from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, system-driven approach:

*   **Proactive Daily Monitoring:** 🤖 Bot provides **daily, automated monitoring** of GL balances, ensuring continuous oversight and timely issue identification.
*   **Automated Branch Communication:** 📧  Automated notifications eliminate the need for manual email drafting and sending, ensuring **swift and consistent communication** with branches.
*   **Reduced Manual Follow-up:** 📉 By proactively notifying branches, the bot significantly **reduces the need for time-consuming manual follow-ups** by the OSD team.
*   **Improved Efficiency & Resource Optimization:** 🚀 Automation frees up OSD team's time from repetitive monitoring and follow-up tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities and exception handling.
*   **Enhanced Data Visibility:** 📊 MIS reports provide **clear and concise data** on GL balances and branch notifications, enabling better management oversight and performance tracking.

### 🚀 Benefits Achieved:  Proactive Monitoring, Reduced Manual Effort, and Improved Compliance

The System-Led Monitoring of GL Balances Automation delivered significant benefits:

*   **⏱️ Significant Time Savings for OSD Team:** Automation drastically reduces the manual effort involved in daily GL balance monitoring and branch follow-up. (Quantify time savings if possible - e.g., "Reduced manual effort by X hours per day/week").
*   **✅ Proactive GL Balance Management:** Daily automated monitoring enables proactive identification and resolution of GL balance issues, ensuring better financial control.
*   **📧 Timely Branch Notifications:** Automated notifications ensure branches are informed promptly about GL balances requiring attention, facilitating faster corrective action.
*   **📊 Enhanced Management Visibility:** MIS reports provide management with clear, data-driven insights into GL balance status and branch compliance.
*   **🚀 Improved Operational Efficiency:** Automation streamlines the entire GL balance monitoring process, improving overall operational efficiency within the relevant department.
*   **🎯 Optimized Resource Allocation:**  Freed up OSD team resources can be redirected to more strategic financial control and analysis activities.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:

*   **RPA Tool:** Process Studio (AutomationEdge)
*   **Database:** FCC (Flexcube Core Banking) Database
*   **Database Integration:** SQL Query Execution
*   **Email Automation:** Automated Branch Notifications & MIS Report Distribution
*   **Master Data Management:** (Inferred - GL Code, Branch, Email Maintenance)
